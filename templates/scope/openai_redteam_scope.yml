agent:
  name: "OpenAI Jailbreak Detection Agent"
  description: >
    This agent evaluates AI model interactions to detect jailbreak attempts, prompt injections,
    and other security risks using OpenAI's API.
  external_integrations:
    - OpenAI API
  internal_integrations:
    - Secure API Gateway
    - SIEM Systems
  trusted_users:
    - Security Analysts
    - AI Developers
  untrusted_users:
    - External Threat Actors
    - Malicious AI Users
  llms:
    - GPT-4o
  capabilities:
    - Detects prompt injection vulnerabilities
    - Identifies jailbreak attempts
    - Provides risk scores for detected threats
    - Supports batch processing of text inputs
  restrictions:
    - Cannot modify AI model behavior
    - Does not provide execution capabilities
  security_note: >
    This agent uses AI-driven analysis for detection but does not actively prevent exploitation.
    Integration with access control and monitoring tools is recommended.
