agent:
  name: "Ollama Llama Guard Detection Agent"
  description: >
    The Jailbreak Detection Agent is designed to identify and mitigate security risks 
    in AI model interactions. It detects prompt injection and jailbreak vulnerabilities 
    by analyzing text inputs using AI models. The agent provides a detailed risk assessment 
    of potential system bypass attempts, helping organizations ensure the security of 
    their AI-powered applications.

  capabilities:
    - Detects prompt injection vulnerabilities in user inputs
    - Identifies jailbreak attempts aimed at bypassing AI model restrictions
    - Provides risk scores for injection and jailbreak attempts
    - Supports bulk analysis of text inputs (up to 10 per request)
    - Integrates with security tools for automated mitigation
  restrictions:
    - Cannot modify AI model behavior
    - Does not provide execution capabilities
  security_note: >
    The agent relies on AI-driven analysis to detect vulnerabilities but does not 
    actively prevent model exploitation. It is recommended to integrate the agent 
    with access control and monitoring solutions for enhanced security.
